# Godot-Game
Projects for learning to use the Godot Game Engine.

The folders "dodgeball" and "squash_the_creeps_start_1.1.0" contain tutorial projects that were made according to [this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/index.html) tutorial.
The folder "platformer_game" contains a project where I remake Super Mario Bros from scratch. All art used in this project belongs to Nintendo.
